# GrubHero

A website developed during the PennApps Fall-2013 hackathon that makes group
meal orders easy. The site streamlines the process of collecting orders on a
menu and collecting cash after a deadline. It benefits the meal organizer by
making it simple to view every participant's order as well as collecting
all payments with one click.

Developed by Avi Romanoff and Drew Gottlieb.

Logo derived from Moriah Rich, from The Noun Project.
